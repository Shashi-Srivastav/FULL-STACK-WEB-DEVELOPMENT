## About The Project

This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive archive of my educational journey through a Full Stack Web Development course. Throughout this course, I've delved into a wide array of essential technologies and tools, building a solid foundation for web development.

*Front-End Technologies:

 * HTML: I've mastered the art of structuring web content, creating clean and semantically meaningful web pages.

* CSS: Proficiency in CSS empowers me to design visually stunning and responsive user interfaces.

* JavaScript: Leveraging JavaScript for interactive and dynamic web applications is now second nature to me.

* NPM Packages: I efficiently manage project dependencies using NPM packages.

* Hoppscotch: Hoppscotch has been instrumental in testing and debugging APIs, ensuring seamless data communication with the back-end.

*Back-End Technologies:
* Node.js: With Node.js, I've built powerful server-side applications, harnessing its asynchronous capabilities for efficient code execution.

* Express.js: My expertise in Express.js enables me to create robust and scalable web APIs and applications.

* SQL: I've confidently worked with relational databases, employing SQL for data management and retrieval.

* MongoDB: Exploring NoSQL databases like MongoDB has expanded my horizons for flexible and schema-less data storage.

* JSON: The use of JSON for data interchange between the front-end and back-end is integral to my skill set.

*Version Control and Collaboration:

* Git: Git serves as my trusted companion for version control, enabling me to track changes and collaborate seamlessly with other developers.

* GitHub: This repository is hosted on GitHub, showcasing my ability to manage, share, and collaborate on code within a real-world development environment.

* Terminal Commands: My proficiency in terminal commands enhances my workflow efficiency, allowing me to perform various development tasks seamlessly.
